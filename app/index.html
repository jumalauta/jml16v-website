      <h1>Jumalauta Sweet Sixteen</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">2. &mdash; 4. 9. 2016</p>
    </header>
    <p>It’s time for another special celebration of Jumalauta! You only turn sixteen once per each
      base greater than 6. That calls for the party of a lifetime, of course, so join us, put on a
      complimentary tiara, open a beverage and let your inner teen princess shine at JML SWEET
      SIXTEEN!</p>

    <p>Of course, we will again have compos of the highest quality, to tell who are the true
      princesses and who are just boring peons. Further details about the compos can be found below.
      Life’s never boring when you party with us!</p>

    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>We have once again booked the majestic Härkälinna castle in the heart of Finland, Hauho. The
      place is about 35 km from Hämeenlina and 60 km from Tampere. For more information
      about the party place, check
      <a href="http://www2.mokkihaku.fi/cabin/info/id/13085">http://www2.mokkihaku.fi/cabin/info/id/13085</a>
    </p>
    <p>Tickets are <strong>20&euro;</strong> for a regular entry or <strong>40&euro;</strong> if
      you want a spot in a cabin (cabins will be handled on a first come, first served basis).</p>

    <h3>Accommodation</h3>
    <p>We have also booked some cabins right next to the castle, which are available for our guests. Each of the cabins will of course have beds for a handful of people and they are also equipped with fridges, microwave ovens, bathrooms and other amenities. There's also beds for 20 or so people inside the castle in case you just want to crash there. The beds will have mattresses and pillows, but you should bring your own sleeping gear like sleeping bags or bed sheets.</p>

    <h3>Arriving</h3>
    <p>The partyplace is located in Hauho, about 35km from Hämeenlinna. The easiest way to get there
      is by your own car (or hitching a ride from your fellow Jumalauta members).</p>
    <p><strong>By car:</strong> Drive 2.5km from Hauho on route 12 towards Lahti. Turn left to route
      3223 (Sappee, Luopioinen) and drive about 2 km. Turn left on sign "Leppäniemen Hirsihuvilat"
      and drive Leppäniemen tie about 2 km. When you arrive to a yellow farm house - you're
      there!</p>
    <p><strong>By public transport:</strong> You can get to Hämeenlinna by a train or a bus.
      <em>Please note that last year's celebration was a special occasion and this time we won't
        be offering any pickups from Hämeenlinna. So if you need a ride, talk to others who are also
        going.</em></p>
    <p><strong>For GPS:</strong> Leppäniementie 196, 14700 Hauho</p>
